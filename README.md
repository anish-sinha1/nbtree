### B-Trees

This repository contains a correct implementation of an interface to create B-Trees of arbitrary order. The
implementation exactly follows the description found in chapter 18 of *Algorithms* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and
Stein.

This was so remarkably painful to construct but the results are honestly beautiful.

Enjoy!
